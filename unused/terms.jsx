          <u>Introduction</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to Silver Era Transition, a business based in the Netherlands
          that specializes in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) support
          within the IT industry. We offer a match-making service, business
          optimization strategy services, and financial organization services
          through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These Terms
          and Conditions ("Terms") govern the use of our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Acceptance of Terms</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing or using our services, you agree to comply with and be
          bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with these
          Terms and Conditions, please do not use our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Nature of Services</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is pertinent to underscore that while our AI-driven services aim
          for precision, they are not legally binding and should not replace
          professional due diligence. Due to the complex and multi-faceted
          nature of M&amp;A transactions, our services are designed to assist
          but not substitute for expert financial and legal advice (Grossman
          &amp; Cormack, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Limitation of Liability</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Silver Era Transition shall not be liable for any errors,
          inaccuracies, or incomplete information provided through our services.
          We expressly disclaim all liability for any losses, damages, or
          consequences directly or indirectly related to the use of our services
          (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Jurisdiction and Governing Law</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of the Netherlands. All disputes arising out of these Terms will be
          subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Netherlands
          (Council Regulation EC No 44/2001, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Amendments</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Silver Era Transition reserves the right to modify these Terms at any
          time. It is your responsibility to regularly review these Terms to
          stay informed of updates.

          <em>
            In this introductory section, it is important to clearly identify
            the business name, location, and the core services provided. The
            mention of the services being powered by Artificial Intelligence

            This statement underscores the contractual nature of these terms and
            conditions. When users access or use Silver Era Transition's
            services, they are essentially entering into an agreement with the
            company, obliging them to adhere to the stipulated terms. It also
            provides a clear opt-out option for those who do not wish to accept
            these terms, respecting the principles of consent and autonomy in
            contract law (McKendrick, 2019).

            This section explains the crucial distinction between the services
            provided by Silver Era Transition and the legal due diligence
            process. While the AI-driven services aim for precision and
            efficiency, they are not legally binding and should not be
            considered a replacement for expert financial and legal advice. This
            statement is essential in managing the user's expectations and
            reducing the risk of legal disputes.

            This clause serves as a disclaimer of liability, a common practice
            in terms and conditions documents. It explicitly states that Silver
            Era Transition is not responsible for errors, inaccuracies, or
            incomplete information generated by its services. The clause also
            emphasizes that the company disclaims any responsibility for losses,
            damages, or other consequences resulting from the use of its
            services, in accordance with principles of limited liability
            (Feldman, 2016).

            This section addresses the legal framework within which Silver Era
            Transition operates. It specifies that the terms are governed by
            Dutch law and establishes the exclusive jurisdiction of Dutch courts
            in case of any disputes. Such a choice of law and forum clause is a
            common feature in international contracts, providing clarity on
            applicable legal standards and venues for dispute resolution (Gamble
            &amp; Weidner, 2018).
