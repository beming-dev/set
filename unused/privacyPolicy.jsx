          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Introduction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Silver Era Transition is committed to protecting the privacy and
          security of personal information. This section of our Privacy Policy
          outlines the types of personal data we collect, the purposes for which
          we collect it, and the lawful bases under the General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR) that justify these processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Types of Personal Data Collected</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We collect the following categories of personal information.</p>
        <ol start={1} type={1}>
          <li>
            <strong>Contact Information</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To communicate with buyers and sellers, including but not limited to
          email addresses and phone numbers.
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The primary purpose for collecting contact information such as email
            addresses and phone numbers is to enable direct communication
            between Silver Era Transition and its clients. This communication is
            essential for providing updates on potential matches, discussing
            transaction details, and offering customer support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lawful Basis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The collection of contact information is primarily based on the
            performance of a contract. Engaging with [Your Company Name]'s
            services forms a contractual relationship, where effective
            communication is a fundamental part. Consent may also play a role,
            especially in marketing communications, where individuals have the
            option to opt-in or out.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start={2} type={1}>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Details of the Business Being Sold</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To assess and facilitate the matching of buyers and sellers based on
          the financial criteria of the businesses involved.
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial details are collected to accurately assess the value and
            suitability of businesses within the M&amp;A process. This
            information allows Silver Era Transition to match sellers with
            buyers who have similar financial expectations and capacities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lawful Basis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The processing of financial details is necessary for the performance
            of a contract where Silver Era Transition agrees to provide M&amp;A
            matching services. Additionally, legitimate interests may serve as a
            basis when analysing market trends and opportunities without
            directly engaging in a contract.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start={3} type={1}>
          <li>

            <strong>Purpose</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            This information is used to filter potential matches, ensuring that
            buyers are only presented with businesses that fall within their
            investment criteria. It enhances the efficiency of the matching
            process and ensures relevance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lawful Basis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The processing is underpinned by the performance of a contract and
            legitimate interests. It is in the interest of both Silver Era
            Transition and its users to facilitate matches that are financially
            feasible and aligned with the buyer's expectations.
          </li>

        <ol start={4} type={1}>
          <li>
            <strong>General Company Information</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Such as company size, industry sector, and other relevant operational
          details.
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Collecting information about the company's size, industry sector,
            and other operational details enables Silver Era Transition to
            create a comprehensive profile for matching purposes. This data
            helps in identifying the best potential matches based on business
            characteristics and market needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lawful Basis</strong>: The lawful basis here is the
            performance of a contract, as this information is crucial for
            fulfilling the service agreement. Legitimate interests also apply,
            as the data supports Silver Era Transition in market analysis and
            service improvement.

        </ul>
        <ol start={5} type={1}>

            <strong>Location of the Company</strong>
          </li>

        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Location data is vital for matching companies geographically, which
            can be a critical factor in M&amp;A transactions. It allows for the
            consideration of logistical, regulatory, and strategic factors that
            are location dependent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lawful Basis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Similar to other categories, the processing of location data is
            justified by the performance of a contract and legitimate interests.
            Ensuring geographically relevant matches improves the service's
            effectiveness and efficiency.
